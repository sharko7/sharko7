As the Head of Logistics at **[Upside Down Labs](https://upsidedownlabs.tech/)**, I play a key role in ensuring the efficient flow of resources for our mission to make neuroscience accessible to all. We specialise in developing affordable, open-source DIY kits for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) and Human-Computer Interface (HCI) applications, making the study of biopotential signals (EEG, EMG, ECG, EOG) accessible to students, researchers, and enthusiasts.

My professional interests also span:

* **DIY Neuroscience:** Actively engaged in hands-on development and exploration within the open-source neurotechnology space.
* **Content Creation:** Developing informative and engaging content to foster knowledge sharing and community growth in tech and neuroscience.
* **Technological Exploration:** Continuously exploring emerging technologies and their potential for innovation and practical application.

Beyond our educational kits, Upside Down Labs offers comprehensive hardware development services, from PCB design and prototyping to engineering consultation and mass production.
